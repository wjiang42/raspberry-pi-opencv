# raspberry-pi-opencv

This project is an attempt at object tracking using a Raspberry Pi. Through a camera on a rotating platform, an object detection model was run to direct the platform to tilt up/down and left/right. 

Camera access and object detection used OpenCV. The model used for testing is yolov3-tiny, the one of the fastest object detection models currently available. 

#### Components Used
- Raspberry Pi 4
- Raspberry Pi Camera V2
- Arducam Pan-Tilt Camera Platform
